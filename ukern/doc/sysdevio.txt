SYSDEV I/O Specification.

0. Introduction
===============

SYSDEV is a per-process private device, automatically added to the
process's bus on creation.

It controls system resources specific to the process but handled by
the kernel.

SYSDEV is partitioned in the following system.

 1. Timers
 2. Memory Controller
 3. Bus Controller
 4. Miscellanea


1. Timers
=========

SYSDEV provides the user of two timers: a real-time timer (RTT) and a
virtual-time timer (VTT).
RTT is started shortly after the bootstrap of the system and follows
real (i.e. wall clock) time.
VTT is started with the creation of the process and measures the time
the process has been effectively running. VTT is paused when the
process is descheduled, and resumed when the process is running.


List of I/O ports:

 - SYSDEVIO_TMRPRD(0): RO

  Bit 0-64: Timer Counter Period. - RO

      	    Returns the period in femtoseconds (10^-15 secs) of a tick
      	    of the timers. This value (TMRPRD), can be used to
      	    translate counter values, used by the device, into
      	    seconds.


 - SYSDEVIO_RTTCNT(1): RD

 Bit 0-64: RTT Counter - RD

     	   Returns the current value of the real-time timer (RTT)
     	   counter. The system counter is set to zero shortly after
     	   boot time and continuosly incremented (see
     	   SYSDEVIO_TMRPRD).


 - SYSDEVIO_RTTALM(1): WR

 Bit 0-32: RTT Alarm (RTTA) - WR

     	   Arm the timer to raise a RTTINT interrupt in RTTA ticks of
     	   the real-time timer.

 Bit 0-64: Reserved. - MBZ

     	   These bits should be set to zero.


 - SYSDEVIO_VTTCNT(1): RD

 Bit 0-64: VTT Counter - RD

     	   Returns the current value of the virtual time timer (VTT)
     	   counter. The system counter is set to zero at process
     	   creation time and incremented only when the process is
     	   running.


 - SYSDEVIO_VTTALM(1): WR

 Bit 0-32: VTT Alarm (VTTA) - WR

     	   Arm the timer to raise a  VTTINT interrupt in VTTA ticks of
     	   the virtual-time timer.

 Bit 0-64: Reserved. - MBZ

     	   These bits should be set to zero.


List of Interrupts:

 - IRQ0 - RTTINT

   	  Raised by the RTT Alarm.


 - IRQ1 - VTTINT

   	  Raised by the VTT Alarm.
