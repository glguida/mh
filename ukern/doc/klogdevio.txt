KLOGDEV I/O Specification.

0. Introduction
===============

KLOGDEV is a global device, always present.

It is used to retrieve log data produced by the kernel. Its owner is
the super user, and only one process can open it.


List of I/O ports:

 - KLOGDEVIO_GETC(0): RO

  Bit 0-64: Kernel Log Buffer Read. - RO

      	    Retrieve characters from the kernel log packed into the
	    64bit value.  I/O size of the operation (byte, word,
	    doubleword, quadword), affects the number of 8-bit
	    characters stored (one, two, four, and eight). In case
	    more than one character is requested, characters are
	    stored in order, the first in the MSB and the last
	    in the LSB.

 - KLOGDEVIO_SZ(1): RO

  Bit 0-64: Kernel Log Buffer Size. - RO

      	    Return the number of characters currently stored in the
      	    kernel log buffer.

 - KLOGDEVIO_IE: RW

  Bit 0: AVL Interrupt Enable registers (AVLIE) - RW

      	    On write, request AVLINT when the Kernel Log Buffer is non-empty.

  Bit 1-63: Reserved.

 - KLOGDEVIO_ISR: RW

  Bit 0: AVL Interrupt Status Register (AVLISR) - WTC

      	     This bit is set to 1 by the device when the AVL interrupt
      	     is raised. No further AVL interrupt will be raised (if
      	     enabled) until this bit is set.

	     Writing 1 to this bit clears the bit, and if AVLIE is on
	     a new AVL interrupt will be raised when a new character
	     is added to the Kernel Log Buffer.
	     Clearing AVLISR with AVLIE set and characters available
	     in the Kernel Log Buffer does not raise an AVLINT.
	     

List of Interrupts:

 - AVLINT(0): Available Characters Interrupt

	     This interrupt is raised (see AVLIE, AVLISR) when a
	     character is added to the Kernel Log Buffer.
