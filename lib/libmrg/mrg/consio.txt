CONSOLE I/O Specification

List of I/O ports:

 - DEVSTS(0): Device status port R/W

   Bit 0: Keyboard Data Valid. - R/W

       	  On read, 1 indicates that there is data available in the
       	  Keyboard Data Port (KBDATA). 0 indicates that data in the
       	  KBDATA port should NOT be considered valid input

	  Writing  0 to  this port  is ignored,  writing 1  forces the
	  device  to update  the  value  of KBDATA.   If  new data  is
	  available,    this   bit    is    set,    and   KBDATA    is
	  updated. Otherwhise KBDATA is unchanged  and this bit is set
	  to 0.
